# Circular Doubly Linked-List C

This is a simple implementation of Circular Doubly Linked-List in C. Circular Doubly Linked-List is a data structure that is a combination of a doubly linked list and a circular linked list. It is a linked list where all nodes are connected to each other. It is a circular linked list because all nodes are connected to each other. It is a doubly linked list because each node has a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node. The last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node. This makes it easy to traverse the list in both directions. It is also easy to insert and delete nodes from the list. The only disadvantage of a circular doubly linked list is that it takes up more memory than a regular doubly linked list because each node has two pointers instead of one. This is because each node has a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node.
